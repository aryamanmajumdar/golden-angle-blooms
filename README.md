# golden-angle-blooms

For an "art of science" project.
Paints a series of bloom iterations based on the golden angle b.
The structure of the bloom is determined by n*b, 
where n is any positive integer and is the changing parameter across iterations.
Variations of the bloom are explained as comments in the code
